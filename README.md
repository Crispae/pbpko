## PBPK Ontology

The PBPK (Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic) ontology is designed to support the modeling and understanding of pharmacokinetics in biological systems. This documentation provides an overview of the ontology development workflow, the imported ontologies, and the specific terms used in PBPK ontology.

NOTE: Detailed documentation of ontology can be found at this [link](https://crispae.github.io/pbpko/)

#### Development Workflow

The development of the PBPK ontology leverages the ROBOT (ROBOT is an OBO Tool) framework, which provides powerful tools for ontology development, including ontology merging, reasoning, and template-based term generation.

#### Imported Ontologies

1. Uberon : A multi-species anatomy ontology covering anatomical structures in animals.
2. IAO : Provides terms for representing information entities.
3. OBCS : Supports biobanking and clinical research.
4. GO : Describes gene functions and processes in a species-independent manner.

#### PBPK terms vocabulary

PBPK terms are available in [ROBOT template](https://github.com/Crispae/pbpko/blob/main/Robot/templates/vocab.tsv)

#### Contact and Support

For questions or support regarding the PBPK ontology, please open an issue in the GitHub repository or contact the maintainers directly.
